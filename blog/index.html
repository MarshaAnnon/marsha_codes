                <h2><span>Hello &amp; Wecome to</span> Marsha Codes Blog</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Marsha. I'm really pleased I'm on a path that encompasses all the things I love to do. One of the most important things teaching for 13 years taught me was that knowledge is power and shared knowledge is strength and this is the inspiration behind this blog. I am at the beginning of my journey and by no means an expert, I am still studying and discovering just how brillant this coding thing is. This blog will document my growth as a developer, my struggles, my wins, and my failures. I will share resources I find along the way, code bites, and the occasional anecdote.  The Marsha Codes website will be my canvas as I progress through my courses at skillcrush.com and I work on building new skills.
                    I'm really excited to share my journey with you and hope that we can contribute to each other's growth through knowledge sharing.</p>
