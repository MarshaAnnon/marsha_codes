                <p>Here I put my Photoshop skills to work, extracting images, color coding, fonts &amp; sizing. Then set about recreating the structure in HTML &amp; styling in CSS. I also added a menu page to the site, reachable through the navigation bar. This was a super fun project to work on as it allowed me to test out everything I'd learned and reaffirmed my love of front-end development.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

                <p>The objective was to code up my own version of the Holstee Manifesto in a new &amp; creative way. The main challenge was getting all of the individual quotes to float and align for a symmetrical, professional look. I choose to use borders to seperate my blocks for a clean, poster-worthy feel &amp; the color of the year for a fresh up-to-date feel.</p>
